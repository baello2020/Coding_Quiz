# Coding Quiz Challenge

This project was designed as a homework assignment for [Trilogy Education Services and University of Washington](https://bootcamp.uw.edu/coding/) coding bootcamp.

This is a timed quiz, multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This application emphasizes the use of Javascript to provide quiz questions and collect user data to determine whether the answers to a question are correct, this then generates a score and appends a final page of results from the user data. I also added a feature that randomized the questions everytime the application starts and real time scoring that tells the user if the answer is correct(green) or wrong(Red).

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link. Or, download the sources files to use this as a template.
